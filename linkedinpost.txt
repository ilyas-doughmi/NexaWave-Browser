ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: NexaWave Browser! ðŸŒŠ

I've developed a modern web browser from scratch using Python and PyQt5, focusing on clean design and essential browsing features.

âœ¨ Key Features:
â€¢ Sleek, modern UI with custom styling
â€¢ Smart tab management with intuitive controls
â€¢ Intelligent URL handling with integrated Google search
â€¢ URL auto-completion for faster browsing
â€¢ High DPI support for crystal-clear visuals on modern displays
â€¢ Clean navigation with all essential browser controls

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
â€¢ Python
â€¢ PyQt5
â€¢ Qt WebEngine
â€¢ Modern CSS styling with QSS

This project demonstrates how powerful Python can be for desktop application development. I designed NexaWave to be lightweight yet feature-rich, with careful attention to user experience and visual aesthetics.
